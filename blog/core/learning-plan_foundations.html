          <p>
            I've always loved creating something, and I really like the idea of being able to make cool websites or apps just being home using your laptop.
          <p>I would like to develop communication skills and boost my
            confidence during this course so that I can present myself better to
            future employer or clients.</p>
          <p> I’ve been managing so far work and
            learning the material provided by planning out my week and setting
            the goals for each day.</p>
          <p>If things will build up and I realise that
            I’m running out of time I will ask for help in case there’s
            something I don’t understand. </p>
          <p></p>All the fasciliators were really good
            answering everyone’s questions and helping people out so I expect it
            to last the same way and can't wait for the start of Bootcamp when I can see in real life how they solve problems and be able to learn from them.</p>
