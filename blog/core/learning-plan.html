      <h2>
        What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
      </h2>
      <p>
        In the next five years, I aspire to become a software developer. I have already taken basic online courses, and
        studying at Dev Academy will bring me one step closer to my goal. In the very long run I would like to get some
        knowledge on AI and Robotics software Engineering.
      </p>
      
      <h2>
        What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Going through foundations taught me about growth mindset and made me understand where my limitations are coming
        from. Now, knowing what the problem is instead of accepting it I will work on minimizing the consequence of it.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I think public speaking might be the most challenging part of a bootcamp for me . But on the other hand I
        realize that itâ€™s a safe environment and itâ€™s a really good practice for my future career. I am also a bit
        worried that the events happening in the world might add more stress for me during a bootcamp. Itâ€™s good to know
        that there will be a human skills facilitator who you can alway talk to.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Firstly, I would like to improve my communication skills. With strong communication skills, you can clearly
        impact your life. Good communicators bring solutions, drive change, motivate and inspire others. According to
        many surveys every year, verbal and written communication skills are always ranked in the top desirable skills
        by the employer. Itâ€™s especially important in the tech industry, where you have to work with many people
        building one project. So good communication becomes a key for success of a project.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?      
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Facilitation Team has been really helpful during foundations. I expect professionalism, support and most
        importantly - <b>patience</b>. Thank you for all your hard work!
      </p>
      <h2>
        Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely way?
        Write down a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an
        explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators
        and industry/community representatives.    
      </h2>
      <p>
        I think itâ€™s gonna be a lot easier now to ask for help since we will be in the same space. Iâ€™ll try my best to :
        <br> Code hard and SLEEP harder;
        <br> Eat healthy;
        <br> Drink waterðŸ¤ž
        <br> Continue practice mindfulness;
        <br> Rest at least one day a week;
        <br> Excercise
