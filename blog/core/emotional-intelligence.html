       EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE
      </div>

        <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
        Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand and control your
        own emotions and thoughts and of people around you. In modern world
        emotional intelligence is what makes one successful rather than IQ.
        <p>
          The good thing is that everyone can train and improve aspects that
          form the EQ such as:
        </p>
      
        <div id="eQ">
          <ul>
            <li>
              self-awareness (ability to notice your feeling and understand what
              they mean)
            </li>
            <li>
              self regulation ( ability to control your emotions and reactions
              to those feelings)
            </li>
            <li>
              motivation ( being able to motivate yourself and others without an
              external support
            </li>
            <li>
              empathy (ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes,
              understand their point of you and being able to handle conflicts
            </li>
            <li>
              social skills (being a good communicator, knowing how to resolve a
              problem and inspiring others)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
          <p>
            Probably every one of us met someone really smart who posseses a
            high iq, but for some reason didn't seem that successful in life or
            happy. That's why it's important to have a balance and work in both
            directions, improving both eq and technical skills.
