          <h2>
            Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.
          </h2>
          <h3>
            Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.
            Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the
            decision you made, and the consequences of your action.
          </h3>

          <p>
            Our values isn’t something we were born with, it’s something we
            acquire daily based either on our own actions and decisions or the
            environment we live in. My values from today may differ a lot from
            few years ago. The biggest change Happened to me after coming to New
            Zealand and realising how far this country progressed ecology wise.
            I learned what impact fashion industry I was working in has on our
            planet. Once I got the knowledge of how things are behind the
            scenes, what conditions people make fabrics and other supplies in,
            how much land and water it takes to produce one piece of garment, I
            knew I don’t want to contribute to this problem anymore and I have
            to find an alternative. I started making clothes out of fabrics and
            clothes I found in op shops. This way I ended up with new authentic
            clothes I could wear or sell, rescued old garments going to a
            landfill and saved water by not getting new fabrics. We’re facing
            ethical dilemmas everyday. It’s our daily choices and habits that
            shape the person we become. Do we choose something cheaper knowing
            it won’t last that required a big amount of resources, do we throw
            our recycling in the bin because we can’t be boThered cleaning it,
            do we throw away a lot of food because we don’t feel like it and
            didn’t plan our shopping well? We can’t always live just in the
            moment but have to think about consequences of our actions and how
            it will affect future generations.

          <h3>
            Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
          </h3>

          <p>
            I come from Ukraine, a country with a very long history which main
            values also changed over the time, influenced by the countries it
            was controlled by. Main value that stayed unchanged is the strive
            for independence and freedom. My country, being a part of Soviet
            Union, adapted ideas of communism that in my opinion taught the
            society to be respectful, generous and hardworking but on the other
            hand it made people humble, content with what they have and not
            being able to ask for more from life. This mood transferred over the
            generations and you can still notice these treats in some people
            including myself. Despite of all of us being a part of one huge
            ecosystem, what really makes our life unique and memorable is our
            individuality and being able to add value to this system. So I’m
            still trying to learn how to fit into this modern individualistic
            world.

          <h2>
            Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and
            limitations.
          </h2>
          <h3>
            Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning
            and career development.
          </h3>
          <p>
            First thing that come to my mind when I think of my strength is
            independence and being able to work without strict guidelines and
            constant clarifications of next actions. However it comes with a
            consequence of having less communication and building stronger
            relationship with whoever i work with. I would call myself and
            action-oriented person and I find it so much easier to just do the
            thing and learn in the process rather than spending hours thinking
            of how to do it and why. It sometimes also can result into bad
            communication and difficulty in trying to describe my work.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning
            journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.
          </h3>
          <p>
            I think my independence might be helpful in the learning process, by
            being able to find the information I need to solve the problem I
            need to have. I’d also like to believe that I have good problem
            solving skills.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to
            work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension.
            Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they
            were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try
            now and why.
          </h3>
          <p>
            Back at university I had to do a fashion collection collaborating
            with another designer. I found that our approaches to work were
            different and we were working with different speed and attitude.
            Because we were taking part in a competition I wanted us to succeed
            and present something great with good quality. The deadlines were
            close and half of the planned job hasn’t been accomplished. So I
            decided to talk to her and understand what was the thing stopping
            her, I persuaded that the benefits and opportunities after
            completing this collection will be worse putting a bit more effort
            at that point of time. Eventually we made the collection on time and
            made the competition.
