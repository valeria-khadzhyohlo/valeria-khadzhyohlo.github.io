          <h2>BOX MODEL</h2>
          <p>
            In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and
            layout. The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around
            every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and
            the actual content. Bacically, it's a our fabric where we place our
            patterns.
          </p>

          <h2>Margin</h2>
          <p>
            Margin is the space between the border and the next element of your
            design. Think of the space outside the border and between it and the
            other elements. This is all the margin. Margin goes around all all
            sides of our pattern and you can target and change the margin for
            each side. Luckily, here, we can leave as much margin as we want
            without wasting our fabric!
          </p>
          <h2>Padding</h2>
          <p>
            Padding is the space thatâ€™s inside the element between the element
            and the border. Padding goes around all the sides of the content
            and you can target and change the padding for each side (just like a
            margin). So looking at a pattern it would be our seam allowance. 
            We can either not add any at all or add as much as needed.
          </p>  
  
          <h2>Border</h2>
          <p>
            The border-style shorthand CSS property sets the line style for all
            four sides of an element's border. In our case it will be a cutting
            line. You can change the style of the border as well, making it
            either solid or dotted, dashed or doubled, just as you would making
            pattern and marking the stitching line. Even though in case of css
            it's for beauty only and doesn't have any value behind it.
