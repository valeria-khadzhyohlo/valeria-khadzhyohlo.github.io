        <h2>WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT</h2>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a language that lets you dynamically update the
          content of your page, control media and basically do most actions on
          the page that HTML and CSS can’t . You can compare it to the process
          of making a dress, for example you can dye your fabric in any colour
          you like, you lay your pattern and cut your pieces, then you use
          your sewing machine that can do various functions just as javascript
          does.

        <h2>[ARRAYS] AND {OBJECTS}</h2>
        <p>
          It’s always good to keep your process well planned and working space
          organised and you should do the same with your code. If the order
          comes in a first place that you should store your data in array:
        </p>
        <p class="code">
          <code>
            var makeDress = [‘choosePattern’, prepareFabric’,
            ‘cutPatternPieces’, ‘cutFabric’, ‘assembleDressPieces’]
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          When you retrieve information from an array you get it by index of
          each element. Arrays always start counting from zero, so the first
          element (‘chosePattern') in our array is 0 and the last one
          (‘assembleDressPieces’) is 4. If you wanted to find out what is the
          third action you need to do you would use:
        </p>
        <p class="code"><code>makeDress[2]</code></p>
        <p>
          There’s another way to organise your code, especially if data label
          is more important for you than the order. Let’s organise our storage
          using objects:
        </p>
        <p class="code">
          <code
            >thingsNeeded = { <br />&nbsp;fabric: '2m', <br />&nbsp;threads:
            ['brown', 'white'],<br />
            &nbsp;scissors: 'one',<br />
            &nbsp;buttons: 10 }</code
          >
        </p>
        <p class="code">
          <code
            >console.log(thingsNeeded)<br />{fabric: "2m", threads: Array(2),
            scissors: "one", buttons: 10}</code
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Our object represents key/value pairs. If you want to access amount
          of buttons you have you’d try:
        </p>
        <p class="code">
          <code
            >thingsNeeded.butttons Or <br />
            thingsNeeded[‘buttons’]</code
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          We can also store arrays inside of objects and objects inside of
          arrays. To get the information we can use both key and index:
        </p>
        <p class="code">
          <code>console.log(thingsNeeded['threads'][1]) //white</code>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="main-info">
        <h2>CONTROL FLOW</h2>
        <p>
          So to start making a dress we need some kind of plan so we know
          where to start and what our next actions would be. In JavaScript we
          have control flow, it’s an order on which all the statements are
          being executed. Normally all the code is being run from left to
          right, top to bottom unless it meets some statements such as loops,
          conditionals or functions.
        </p>
        <h2>FUNCTIONS</h2>
        <p>
          Functions is a set of statements that performs a task that often
          takes the input and returns the output. Let’s make a function of
          assembling our dress pieces together. We can have out bodice, skirt
          and sleeves as parameters :
        </p>
        <p class="code">
          <code
            >//DECLARING FUNCTION FOR SEWING A DRESS// <br />
            function sewDress(bodiceFront,bodiceBack, skirt, sleeve1,
            sleeve2){
            <br />&nbsp;let dress = bodiceFront + bodiceBack + skirt + sleeve1
            + sleeve2;<br />
            &nbsp;return dress; } <br />//CALLING OUR FUNCTION//<br />
            sewDress('front','back','skirt','sleeve1','sleeve2')</code
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          The cool thing about functions is that we can use the same one but
          by changing parameters we can get different results, for example if
          we want a shorter sleeve instead of long one or no sleeve at all.
        </p>
        <h2>CONDITIONALS</h2>
        <p>
          If/else statement lets us check if the condition has been met or
          not. For example, If we were assembling the pieces of our dress and
          had to check if we still have enough thread we could write such
          statement:
        </p>
        <p class="code">
          <code
            >let lengthOfThread = 500;<br />
            if (lengthOfThread >= 5){ <br />
            &nbsp;console.log('Keep sewing') <br />
            } else if (lengthOfThread > 0){ <br />&nbsp;console.log("You're
            close to running out of thread, please replace it.")
            <br />}else{<br />
            &nbsp;console.log("Sorry, you're out of thread") <br />}
          </code>
        </p>
        <h2>LOOPS</h2>
        <p>
          Loops are iteration statements that keep running until the loop is
          over or the condition becomes false. Let’s make a loop that helps us
          attach buttons to our dress.
        </p>
        <p class="code">
          <code
            >let amountOfButtonholes = 10<br />
            for (let button = 0; button <= amountOfButtonHoles; button++){<br />
            &nbsp;console.log('Attaching ' + button + ' button')<br />
            }
          </code>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="main-info">
        <h2>DOM</h2>
        <p>So all these things can’t be made without something connecting them
          together. In programming this function is taken over by DOM(Document
          Object Model). Specifically the HTML API connects your javascript to your HTML
          and CSS. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that
          way, programming languages can interact with the page. It can be
          modified with a scripting language like JavaScript. For example, to
          select all the paragrafs in your document you’d use querySelectorAll method and the code
            would look like this : </p>
            <p class="code">
              <code
                >let paragraf = document.querySelectorAll(‘p’)
              </code>
            </p>
        
            </code>
          </p>
        </p>
