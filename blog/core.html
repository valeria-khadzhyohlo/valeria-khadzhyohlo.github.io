        <h2>MY CORE VALUES</h2>
        <p>
          Our values isn’t something we were born with, it’s something we
          acquire daily based either on our own actions and decisions or the
          environment we live in. My values from today may differ a lot from few
          years ago. The biggest change Happened to me after coming to New
          Zealand and realising how far this country progressed ecology wise. I
          learned what impact fashion industry I was working in has on our
          planet. Once I got the knowledge of how things are behind the scenes,
          what conditions people make fabrics and other supplies in, how much
          land and water it takes to produce one piece of garment, I knew I
          don’t want to contribute to this problem anymore and I have to find an
          alternative.<a href="core/core-values.html">more...</a>

        <h2>The story of Htmlla</h2>
        <p>Once upon a time, there was a simple and beautiful girl named Htmlla. 
          She lived with her evil stepmother and two stepsisters. The stepmother did not like her and made her do all the household work. Her stepsisters just never had to work, they just roamed around the house in their fancy dresses. They always made fun of Htmlla because of her plain dressing.
