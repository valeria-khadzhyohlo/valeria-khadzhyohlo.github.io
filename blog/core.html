        <h2>FOUNDATIONS REFLECTION</h2>
        <p>
          Thanks to the core part of the foundation course I learned a lot about neuroplasticity and it helped me realise that
          this nasty voice in my head appeared from having a fixed mindset. I would often start something that I found really
          interesting and intriguing but as soon as I met some difficulties or got bored of the monotonous part of the project.

        <h2>LEARNING PLAN 1.0</h2>
        <p>
          Going through foundations taught me about growth mindset and made me understand where my limitations are coming
      from. Now, knowing what the problem is instead of accepting it I will work on minimizing the consequence of it.<a href="core/learning-plan.html"><span>more...</span></a>

        <h2>NEUROPLASTICITY</h2>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change and adapt as a result of experience.
          Our brains are truly extraordinary, unlike computers, which always get a software update and have the same
          hardware, our brains can change the hardware as well. Different pathways are created and are discarded,
          according to our experiences. By stimulating our brain learning something new we create new connections between
          our neurons and actually change the brain's physical appearance.<a href="core/neuroplasticity.html"><span>more...</span></a>

        <h2>MY CORE VALUES</h2>
        <p>
          Our values isn’t something we were born with, it’s something we
          acquire daily based either on our own actions and decisions or the
          environment we live in. My values from today may differ a lot from few
          years ago. The biggest change Happened to me after coming to New
          Zealand and realising how far this country progressed ecology wise. I
          learned what impact fashion industry I was working in has on our
          planet. Once I got the knowledge of how things are behind the scenes,
          what conditions people make fabrics and other supplies in, how much
          land and water it takes to produce one piece of garment, I knew I
          don’t want to contribute to this problem anymore and I have to find an
          alternative.<a href="core/core-values.html"><span>more...</span></a>

        <h2>EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE</h2>
        <p> Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand and control your
          own emotions and thoughts and of people around you. In modern world
          emotional intelligence is what makes one successful rather than IQ.
          The good thing is that everyone can train and improve aspects that
          form the EQ such as:
