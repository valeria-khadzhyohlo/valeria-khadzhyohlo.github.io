        <h2>MY CORE VALUES</h2>
        <p>
          Our values isn’t something we were born with, it’s something we
          acquire daily based either on our own actions and decisions or the
          environment we live in. My values from today may differ a lot from few
          years ago. The biggest change Happened to me after coming to New
          Zealand and realising how far this country progressed ecology wise. I
          learned what impact fashion industry I was working in has on our
          planet. Once I got the knowledge of how things are behind the scenes,
          what conditions people make fabrics and other supplies in, how much
          land and water it takes to produce one piece of garment, I knew I
          don’t want to contribute to this problem anymore and I have to find an
          alternative.<a href="core/core-values.html">more...</a>

        <h2>EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE</h2>
        <p> Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand and control your
          own emotions and thoughts and of people around you. In modern world
          emotional intelligence is what makes one successful rather than IQ.
