          <p>Box model</p>
          <p>
            In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and
            layout. The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around
            every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and
            the actual content. Bacically, it's a our fabric where we place our
            patterns.<a href="tech/css-margin-boder-padding.html">more...</a>

        <h2>MAKE A DRESS AND LEARN JAVASCRIPT/DOM</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a language that lets you dynamically update the
          content of your page, control media and basically do most actions on
          the page that HTML and CSS canâ€™t . You can compare it to the process
          of making a dress, for example you can dye your fabric in any colour
          you like, you lay your pattern and cut your pieces, then you use
          your sewing machine that can do various functions just as javascript
          does.<a href="tech/javascript-dom.html">more...</a></p>

        <h2>The story of Htmlla</h2>
        <p>Once upon a time, there was a simple and beautiful girl named Htmlla. 
          She lived with her evil stepmother and two stepsisters. The stepmother did not like her and made her do all the household work. Her stepsisters just never had to work, they just roamed around the house in their fancy dresses. They always made fun of Htmlla because of her plain dressing.
